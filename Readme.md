## About The Project

Serenity is a robust and flexible Minecraft Bedrock Edition Server Software that was built from the ground up using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Serenity provides a well written set of apis and tools for building Minecraft Bedrock servers, allowing developers to focus on creating unique gameplay experiences, without worrying about the underlying network and protocol details. As Serenity is still in a early version of development, it is recommended not to use Serenity for any offical purposes, as the code structure of the api will be rapidly changing, and may cause plugins to break without notice.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installing Serenity you first need to make sure you have the lastest recommended version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. Once installed, it is recommened to fully restart your machine to allow for the full Node.js experience to be enabled. You will also need to use an integrated development environment of personal choice. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended environment for Serenity development.

Serenity is built off of the foundation of [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) for quick and easy development. Before installing Serenity, you will first need to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). To do this, please read through the [Installation Guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) provided by the developers of Yarn.

Serenity has started development on a plugin system. This system allows modification to the Serenity software while providing a full api to completely interact with the server. Check out the [sample-plugin](https://github.com/SerenityJS/sample-plugin) to get started.

### Installing Serenity

Clone or download a local copy of the Serenity repository to a perferred area on your machine. You can then open the Serenity folder in your perferred integrated development environment. You will now need to run a few terminal commands before starting.

- First you will need to initialize the folder using Yarn. Copy and run the command `yarn install`, follow any steps that may appear on screen.

- Next you are now ready to build the project, since the project is coded in TypeScript, it will first need to be compiled to JavaScript before running. To do this, run the command `yarn run build`, this command will then compile the project into JavaScript.

- Finally you are now ready to start the Serenity server. To do this run the command `yarn run launch`, you should then see the server starting.
  If you are making modifications to the source code and do not want to rebuild the project each time, run the command `yarn run dev:launch`. This will run the source TypeScript files without having to build each time.
