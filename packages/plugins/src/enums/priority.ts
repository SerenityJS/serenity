/**
 * The priority of a plugin determines when it will be loaded in relation to other plugins.
 * A plugin with a higher priority will be loaded before a plugin with a lower priority.
 * This is useful for plugins that need to be loaded before or after other plugins.
 * For example, a library plugin may need to be loaded before a plugin that uses it,
 * or a plugin that modifies the behavior of serenity's APIs may need to be loaded after it.
 * The default priority is Normal.
